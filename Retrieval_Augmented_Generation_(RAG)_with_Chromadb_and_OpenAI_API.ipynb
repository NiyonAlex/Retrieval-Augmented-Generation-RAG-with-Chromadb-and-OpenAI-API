Retrieval models are excellent at retrieving relevant information from large datasets, while generative models are skilled at producing human-like text. By combining these two approaches, RAG can provide more accurate and relevant responses compared to traditional language models. RAG uses a retriever to search for relevant information and then a generator to create a response based on that information, resulting in more contextually accurate and coherent AI-generated text. This approach enhances the overall performance and quality of AI systems in various applications such as chatbots, question-answering systems, and content generation.\n"
