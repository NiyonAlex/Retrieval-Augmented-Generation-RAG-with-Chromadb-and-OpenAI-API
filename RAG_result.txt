Generated Response: RAG, or Retrieval-Augmented Generation, improves AI by combining the strengths of both retrieval and generative models. Retrieval models are excellent at retrieving relevant information from large datasets, while generative models are skilled at producing human-like text. By combining these two approaches, RAG can provide more accurate and relevant responses compared to traditional language models. RAG uses a retriever to search for relevant information and then a generator to create a response based on that information, resulting in more contextually accurate and coherent AI-generated text. This approach enhances the overall performance and quality of AI systems in various applications such as chatbots, question-answering systems, and content generation.
